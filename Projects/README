Subject Heading:
Simple Temperature and Humidity Alert Display using Arduino Uno

Project Objective:
A simple program formulated to display distance and temperature values using Grove ultrasonic sensor, Grove temperature sensor, and Grove LCD RGB Backlight.

Performance Metrics:

The following conditions shall be met: #1: Grove LCD screen shall display temperature and distance readings from temperature and ultrasonic sensor.

#1: Grove LCD screen shall display temperature and distance readings from temperature and ultrasonic sensor.

#2: If temperature detected is above 23 deg Celsius, Red LED will blink, LCD shall replace temperature reading and display, "Temp Alert!"

#3: If distance detected is above 400 cm, Green LED will blink and LCD shall replace distance reading, and display "Distance Alert!"

#4: Temperature and Distance reading displayed on LCD screen are able to scroll from left to right, and vice versa.
